# CSE-Result-Bot

A simple bot to get your semester results directly in your telegram app. You can access the bot [here](https://t.me/cseresult_bot).     
Up till now this bot works for B.Tech(CSE) <i>2017 batch</i> students of affiliated colleges of IPU.  
Feel free to ask any doubt or questions.  
I converted the results pdf to text files for faster execution of the queries.  
<b>Note:</b> Currently the bot does support results of USIT stdents as they have a seperate result PDF.
## Features
- [x] Semester wise result with percentage, ranks, subject wise marks, and credits.
- [x] Cummulative Percentage calculations.
- [x] College wise rank chart.
- [x] University wise rank chart.
- [x] Percentage over the semesters charts.
- [x] Show internal and external marks in graph.
## New Ideas To Implement
i) Comparison between results of students: Two enrollment numbers as input will be processed and bot will send the comparison graphs.
ii) Saving data to database: Use any database service to save the results instead of using text files.
iii) Save enrollment number: An option for users to save enrollment numbers to save time by not having to type roll no again and again.
iv) Adding more to results: Addidng more details like CGPA, SGPA while displaying results.
v) Backlogs support: Add support for reappear results for correct results of backlog students.
